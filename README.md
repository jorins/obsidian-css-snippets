Personal set of Obsidian snippets.

# `colours.css`

Definition of a personal palette of colours. Obsidian has [a set of predefined
colours](https://docs.obsidian.md/Reference/CSS+variables/Foundations/Colors)
but I didn't quite like these so I made my own set.

# `image-opts.css`

Modifiers that can be applied to images using pipes e.g.

```md
![[path/to/image.png|center]]
```

# `sidebar.css`

Sidebar customisation
